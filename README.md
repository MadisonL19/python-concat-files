# python-concat-files

Welcome! This Python script can be utilized to concatenate multiple Excel files located in the same folder.

The script also chooses which sheet from the workbooks it would like to read and store in the end file. This can be easily configured to read multiple sheets, or this functionality can be removed if you only have one sheet in the workbook.

Short and sweet - enjoy!
